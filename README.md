# SQLAlchemy-challenge

This is an exercise on SQLAlchemy, SQLite and Flask. The purpose is to explor, analyse, and visualize database data.

In Part 1, the task has been to set up the steps using SQLAlchemy library to connect to a SQLite database and retrieve 
tables as python objects. Then, perform operations on tables utilizing Object Relational Mapping (ORM), Pandas and 
Matplotlib.

In Part 2, a Flask app is developed based on the queries done in Part 1. On the homepage, it displays a list of routes.
Each route displays the result of a particular query implemented in the app.

The solution files are located in the SurfsUp folder. The env and venv directories were generated to install and include
the required dependencies.

NOTE: I have worked on this exercise by myself. However, I condulted with the BCS learning assistants a few times.
